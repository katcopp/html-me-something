        <p>Update: Iago has been adopted! Jasmine, Rajah, and Genie are still looking for their furever homes.</p>
        <p>These four kittens were rescued from a kill shelter in Hutchinson, Kansas at the beginning of October.
             After learning their pursanalities, they were named after Aladdin characters: Jasmine, Rajah, Genie, and Iago. </p>
  
        <article> <h2>Jasmine &amp; Rajah</h2>
        <img src="images/Jazz-Raj.jpg" alt="Jasmine and Rajah snuggling" width="600" height="400" >
        <p>Jasmine and Rajah are the twin girls. Jasmine came to her foster home rather lethargic and underweight. 
            Foster mom forced food into her every chance she could, watched her lose precious ounces over a few days and then suddenly
            she started gaining weight!! Rajah was her caretaker throughout the process, making sure she was always protecting from
            her big brothers. They adore their foster home's dog and cat, and constantly beg to hang out with them!!</p>
        
        <h2>Iago &amp; Genie</h2>
        <img src="images/Iago-Genie.jpg" alt="Iago and Genie snuggling" width="600" height="400" >
        <p>Iago and Genie are the big brothers of the group. Iago has the LONGEST legs and he is such a snuggler. Genie is extremely vocal
            and always wants to be around his foster parents or foster dog. He is constantly trying to get the family cat to play with him
            and she even puts up with him, despite not normally liking kittens.
